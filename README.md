# hw08-Making a shiny app

This repo contains the BC Liquor app as a boilerplate for students to add to in Homework 08.

The code and data are from [Dean Attali's tutorial](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial). The code can specifically be found [here](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/#12-final-shiny-app-code).

This assignment requires us to add at least three features to the existing app. My work has been briefly described below. My app is deployed on shinyapp.io and you can view my app via this [link](https://mengli.shinyapps.io/bcl_app/). 

## Features added

* Add an option to sort the results table by price.
* Add an image of the BC Liquor Store to the UI.
* Use the DT package to turn the current results table into an interactive table.
* Add parameters to the plot let the user decide on the colours of the bars in the plot.
* Place the plot and the table in separate tabs.
* Allow the user to download the results table as a ..csv file.
